# VentureForge

## Product Overview

While various products allow for users to create characters for existing TTRPG systems, few allow their users the freedom to create their own systems and character creators that other people can use. This is the focus of VentureForge, platform that allows for the creation, use, and sharing of modules that contain rules, lore, and sheet creators for any TTRPG systems. In short, this means that anyone with access to VentureForge can let their imagination run wild as they create their own games and characters or create characters in any existing system, such as Dungeons & Dragons, Call of Cthulhu, or Cyberpunk.


## Software Assignment Overviews
### Assignment 1: Design the Box

The first step in the software development process was the process of outlining the potential product based on its general concept. In order to accomplish this, we completed a journal that gave a brief overview of the product and its intended audience. Additionally, we created and presented a box that contained information that allowed us to quicky and concisely present the core concept of VentureForge. Based on these two components, we were able to develop a Product Vision, which allowed us to clearly state our intentions for the product.
 In the end, the following became our vision statement:
 #### VentureForge Product Vision
For overwhelmed newcomers to tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) as well as experienced game masters or players who want to use and contribute to character creation tools, but need this process to be user-friendly, versatile, and effective, Venture Forge is a character creation platform that allows for experienced players to generate and adapt character creators based on their own campaigns, and also allows for newcomers to use these player-made systems to generate their own characters and get acquainted with TTRPG systems. Unlike other character creation tools such as D&D Beyond or Roll20, our product encourages one to create, use, and modify character creation tools for any TTRPG system. 

### Assignment 2: Design Artifacts Document

In this phase of development for VentureForge, we identified the features and components that should be implemented in order to create the product that we envisioned. However, this process also required a clear understanding of the types of potential users of the product and their needs, which led us to create personas of three archetypes of users: experienced game masters, experienced players, and newcomers to TTRPGs. From there, we were able to develop scenarios that elaborated on their needs through stories about how these personas might engage with the VentureForge product. These allowed us to clearly express what our features should be able to accomplish as we extrapolated user stories from these scenarios, giving us a series of concise statements about the needed functionality of the product.

### Assignment 3: Architectural Design

Finally, we determined the architecture of the product, which helped to establish the "how" behind the "what" portrayed in the Design Artifacts Document. This design process involved research into possible languages, databases, services, or general components that could be used in order to actually construct and implement VentureForge. While the final prototype only demonstrates some of the potential functionality of the front-end, the final architectural design for VentureForge included Microsoft Azure servers, SQLite databases, and Java Spring Boot microservices.

### Assignment 4: Prototype

Armed with the core concept for the product, specifications on its features, and an understanding of its architecture, we set out to actually implement the front end UI portion of VentureForge with C# and xaml. In all, our goal for the prototype is to demonstrate how users could create their own modules and sheets within those modules as well as save these and bring them back up to use or edit from a different page of the program, meaning that the most in-depth classes will be those related to creating modules and creating sheets. Overall, we hope that this will be a sufficent demonstration of the potential for VentureForge to encapsulate the ability for users to create and use their own TTRPG content.
